# Classification problem for Identifying the Music Genre of Songs

 A custom subset of the Million Song Dataset is classified by the genre of the songs based on 264 bag-of-frames features.
 I use a borderline over-sampling method for imbalanced dataset, and use support vector machnine, logistic regression and XGboost classifier algorithms for the classification.

 # Regression problem: House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
 
 This is a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) in which I different regression methods to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa based on 79 different numerical and categorical features.

 # Tweet Analysis: Tweets from US congress members
 
 I collected 1000 tweets per member of US congress to analyse how differently US senators from either parties use Twitter, and if we can guess which party the senator represents using term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency(TF-IDF) statistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
